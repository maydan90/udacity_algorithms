Input list is used to generate frequency of each digit from 0 to 9 in O(n) time. The resulted frequencies are then used to generate two numbers putting large digits in the high decimal places of each number in linear time.
Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input list. 
Space complexity: O(n) in case all digits are different.
